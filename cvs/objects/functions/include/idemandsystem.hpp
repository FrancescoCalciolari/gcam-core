/*!
 * \ingroup Objects
 * \brief An interface for demand systems 
 * \details A demand system is a set of equations that jointly
 *          determines the demand for a collection of goods.  Demand
 *          is determined as a function of income and prices of all
 *          the goods in the system.  This differs from the simple
 *          demand functions used elsewhere in the model in that the
 *          prices and demands for the goods can affect one another.
 *          For example, there may be cross-price elasticities for
 *          complementary or substitute goods, or a budget constraint
 *          on total expenditures.
 *
 *          A key feature of a demand system is the number of goods 
 *          in the system.  We require this to be set at the creation of
 *          the object, rather than parsed from XML input.  The reason
 *          for this is that a demand system object will always be
 *          owned by a GCAM sector that will be responsible for
 *          collecting input prices from the GCAM markets and
 *          otherwise communicating with the rest of the model.  It's
 *          important for the sector and the demand system to agree on
 *          the number of goods, and we ensure that by having the
 *          parent object set that quantity when it creates the
 *          demands system object.
 *
 *          The second key feature of a demand system is its parameter
 *          list.  These *are* parsed from XML inputs, since the
 *          parent object doesn't need to know what they are.  The
 *          number of parameters need not (and generally won't) be
 *          equal to the number of goods.
 *
 *          A demand system may output either absolute or per capita
 *          values.  The base class holds a flag to track this
 *          property and provides a public method to report on it.
 *          The default, as set by the base class constructor, is per
 *          capita.  Subclasses may override this as required,
 *          including by parsing it from input XML.  However,
 *          they aren't required to do either.

     *       internal state, we may need to rethink how we return this
     *       value, perhaps returning a handle to a section of the
     *       scratch space.  It's unclear, but this should do for
     *       now.

     *          demand values in the same units used by the upstream
